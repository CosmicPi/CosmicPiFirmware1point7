# CosmicPiFirmware1point7
MbedOS firmware for the V1.7 cosmic pi
Will put the source code here as soon as I figure out how to export from mbedOS online compiler

Ballpark settings for the Version 1.7 Cosmic Pi:
DAC = 700 (out of 1024), apply to both channels
HV = 160 to 200 (lower = higher voltage)

THese scripts use stm32flash-code to flash the STM32, based on instructions I followed from here:
